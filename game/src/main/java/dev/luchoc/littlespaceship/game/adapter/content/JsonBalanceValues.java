 * The straightforward {@link BalanceValues}, built once from {@code assets/data/balance.json}.
 *
 * <p>Every field is required in the file — there is no default here, on the same reasoning
 * {@link dev.luchoc.littlespaceship.core.port.ComponentSpec} settled on in {@code core}: a missing
 * balance number silently falling back to a guess is a worse failure than the game refusing to
 * start until content names it.
 *
 * @param initialLives lives the player starts a run with
 * @param maxLives lives the player can never exceed
 * @param initialBombs bombs the player starts a run with
 * @param maxBombs bombs the player can never exceed
 * @param weaponLevels number of shot levels, the base one included
 * @param respawnInvulnerability seconds of invulnerability after respawning
 * @param damageInvulnerability seconds of invulnerability after a hit absorbed by shield or
 *     attachment
 * @param maxedPickupBonus points awarded when a power-up is picked up at maximum
 * @param playerSpeed the ship's top speed, in logical units per second
 * @param playerSlowFactor multiplier applied to {@code playerSpeed} while the precision control is
 *     held
 * @param playerStartX horizontal position the ship is created at
 * @param playerStartY vertical position the ship is created at
 * @param weaponFireCooldown seconds between two volleys of the main weapon
 * @param weaponProjectileSpeed speed of a player projectile once fired
 * @param pickupRadius radius of a pickup's collider
 * @param invulnerabilityPickupDuration seconds of invulnerability granted by the invulnerability
 *     power-up
 * @param lifeCompletionBonus points awarded per remaining life when the level is completed
 * @param bombCompletionBonus points awarded per remaining bomb when the level is completed
 * @param weaponProjectileDamage hit points a player projectile subtracts from an enemy's health
 * @param bombDamage hit points the bomb subtracts from a resistant enemy's health
