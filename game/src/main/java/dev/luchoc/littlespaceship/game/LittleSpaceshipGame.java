/**
 * The composition root: the one place that assembles {@code core} with the libGDX adapters, and now
 * also the one place that owns what every screen shares — the {@link Skin} built once in {@link
 * #create()}, {@link GameSettings}, the run seed, and the level id every run plays.
 *
 * <p>Desktop and web share this class unchanged; only the launcher that constructs the backend
 * differs, per {@code docs/planning/12-architecture.md}.
 *
 * <p>Extending {@link Game} instead of {@code ApplicationAdapter} is what phase 06 task 13 needed:
 * the flow of six screens — menu, ship selection, options, pause, victory, defeat — is libGDX's own
 * {@link com.badlogic.gdx.Screen} abstraction, not a framework built for this project.
 * {@code dev.luchoc.littlespaceship.game.screen} holds one class per screen; gameplay itself moved
 * to {@code screen.PlayScreen} unchanged from what this class used to render directly.
