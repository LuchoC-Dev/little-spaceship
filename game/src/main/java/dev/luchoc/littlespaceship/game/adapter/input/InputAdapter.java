/**
 * Turns keyboard and mouse into one {@link InputFrame} per rendered frame.
 *
 * <p>This is the one place the additive-devices rule from {@code 10-mvp-initial-values.md} is
 * implemented: keyboard and mouse each contribute a vector in logical units per second and the two
 * are summed here, before the core ever sees them. {@code MotionSystem} only clamps the magnitude
 * it is handed — it does not know two devices exist. Summing here is what
 * makes opposite directions cancel instead of one device overriding the other.
 *
 * <p>The mouse is relative, not positional: it contributes the cursor's displacement since the last
 * frame, scaled from screen pixels to logical units and divided by elapsed time, which is what
 * {@link InputFrame}'s unit contract asks for. A positional mouse could not be summed with the
 * keyboard the way the rule requires — teleporting to a target and nudging by a held key are not
 * the same kind of quantity.
 *
 * <p>Reading the pointer's raw displacement needs the pointer captured, or it stops generating
 * delta the moment the cursor reaches a window edge while the player keeps moving the physical
 * mouse. Capture only engages after a click, which is also what the browser's Pointer Lock API
 * requires; on web this is unverified against a real browser, per {@code CLAUDE.md}.
