# 318 — `core` exposes a way to place a pickup with no enemy involved

**Branch:** `feat/content-places-a-pickup`. **Closes:** [#318](https://github.com/LuchoC-Dev/little-spaceship/issues/318).
`core-domain`, `core/` only. First half of the split named in #255: the loader that reads the JSON
(`game/adapter/content/JsonContentSource.java`) is a separate branch, not touched here.

## What was built

A new `core.port` record, `PlacedPickup(float at, String kind, float atX, float atY)`, deliberately
shaped like `SpawnEvent`: `at` means "seconds since the wave that carries it started", `atX`/`atY` are
fractions of the playfield in `[0, 1]`, the same convention `SpawnEvent.atX()` already uses. It lives
on `WaveDefinition` — `List<PlacedPickup> pickups()`, a **default** method returning `List.of()` — not
as a level-level list of its own, so `SpawnSystem` schedules it with the `ActiveWave` clock and cursor
that already exist for spawns, instead of a second scheduling mechanism.

`SimpleWaveDefinition` gained a canonical `(id, spawns, pickups, endCondition)` constructor with the
same "sorted or reject" validation `spawns` already has, plus a back-compat `(id, spawns, endCondition)`
constructor defaulting `pickups` to `List.of()` — the record-constructor trick from phase 07 (`SpawnEvent`
grew `dropSlot` the same way). Confirmed this kept `game`'s existing calls compiling unchanged:
`./gradlew :game:compileJava` is green with no source change on that side.

`SpawnSystem.spawnDue` walks `wave.definition.pickups()` with a second cursor (`ActiveWave.pickupCursor`),
alongside the existing `spawns()` cursor, and creates the pickup entity through a newly package-visible
`CleanupSystem.createFallingPickup(world, x, y, kind)` — the same five components (`Transform`,
`Collider`, `Sprite`, `Pickup`, the falling `Motion` issue #252 already gave every pickup) a dropped
one gets, factored out of `CleanupSystem.spawnDropIfAny` rather than duplicated. An unrecognised kind
fails the moment the placement is due, naming the wave id and the timestamp — `requireRecognisedPickup`,
the same shape as `SpawnSystem`'s existing `requireRecognisedDrop` for an enemy's designed `Drop`, both
asking the one source of truth, `PickupSystem.isRecognisedKind`.

**A placed pickup carries no `WaveOrigin`**, matching a dropped pickup exactly (`CleanupSystem` never
gave one either). This was a deliberate check, not an oversight: `WaveEndCondition.Cleared` asks "does
any entity still carry this wave's id", and a reward the player has no obligation to collect must never
be able to block a level from completing. Pinned by
`placedPickupCarriesNoWaveOrigin` in `SpawnSystemTest`.

## Where it sits in `SystemOrder`

`SystemOrder.SPAWN`, inside the existing `SpawnSystem` — no new system, no new stage. The issue's own
"watch out for" section frames it exactly this way: "a placed pickup enters the world at a scheduled
time, like a spawn." `SpawnSystem` already owns turning a wave's timestamped content into entities at
this stage; a placed pickup is a second kind of timestamped content on the same `WaveDefinition`, not a
different concern needing its own place in the pipeline. Building a new `PickupPlacementSystem` for one
shipped level and a handful of test scenarios would be the general placement engine invariant 6 refuses.

## What the loader (the other half) will need

- `PlacedPickup(float at, String kind, float atX, float atY)` — construct one per JSON entry, same
  validation shape as `SpawnEvent` (throws on a negative/non-finite `at`, an empty `kind`, or an
  `atX`/`atY` outside `[0, 1]`).
- `WaveDefinition`/`SimpleWaveDefinition` now take an optional fourth argument: use the four-argument
  `SimpleWaveDefinition(id, spawns, pickups, endCondition)` constructor when a wave's JSON has a
  `"pickups"` array, the existing three-argument one otherwise — both are still there, so no existing
  call needs to change unless it actually gains pickups.
- The unrecognised-kind message names the **wave id and the timestamp** ("wave 'x' places a pickup at
  Ys with an unrecognised kind 'z'") — `game` should wrap it with the file name the same way it already
  does for every other `ContentSource` failure, per that interface's own class javadoc.

## Ambiguity found in the issue/plan

None that blocked the work. One judgment call worth flagging: "refused at load" (acceptance criterion)
reads most literally as "at content-load time," but the existing precedent for the exact same shape of
problem — an enemy's unrecognised `Drop` kind — is refused when the wave's placement is *due* during
simulation (`SpawnSystem.spawnWave` → `requireRecognisedDrop`), not when the level file is parsed. I
matched that precedent for `PlacedPickup` rather than inventing a second failure point, since content
in this codebase is otherwise never eagerly walked start-to-finish at load for this kind of check (a
level with a wave a player never reaches would never surface a bad drop id either). `SpawnSystemTest`'s
`unrecognisedPlacedPickupKindFailsWithMessage` pins the message; it fires the tick the placement is due,
same as `unrecognisedDropIdFailsAtSpawnTime` already does for `Drop`.

#252 is unaffected by this change, one way or the other: a placed pickup gets the exact same falling
`Motion` a dropped one already does (post-#252 fix), so it does not make the neighbouring issue better
or worse.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `core` exposes a way for content to place a pickup of a given kind at a given time and position,
  with no enemy involved — `PlacedPickup` + `WaveDefinition.pickups()` + `SpawnSystem`.
- [x] Its place in `SystemOrder` is stated and justified — `SystemOrder.SPAWN`, above.
- [x] The rule is asserted by tests named after it — `SpawnSystemTest.placedPickupExistsAtItsScheduledTimeAndPosition`,
  `placedPickupNotDueYetDoesNotExist`, `placedPickupNeedsNoEnemyOrFormation`,
  `placedPickupFallsLikeADroppedOne`, `placedPickupCarriesNoWaveOrigin`,
  `unrecognisedPlacedPickupKindFailsWithMessage`; `PlacedPickup`'s own validation and
  `SimpleWaveDefinition`'s pickup-list validation are pinned in `ContentDefinitionsTest`.
- [x] `core` still has no libGDX on its classpath — `grep -rn "com.badlogic.gdx" core/src/main/java`
  prints nothing. Still reads no clock, still calls no `Math.random()` — no new code touches either.
- [x] `./gradlew build` green, and `:rngparity` (the replay-reproduction module) builds clean as part
  of it.

## Commands run

- `./gradlew :core:test` — green, all new and existing tests pass.
- `./gradlew :game:compileJava` — green, confirms the back-compat constructor kept `game` compiling
  with no source change on that side.
- `./gradlew build` — green across every module (`core`, `game`, `web`, `desktop`, `rngparity`).
- `grep -rn "com.badlogic.gdx" core/src/main/java` — no output.
