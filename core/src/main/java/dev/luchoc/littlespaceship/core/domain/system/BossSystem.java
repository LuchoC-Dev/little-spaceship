/**
 * Level 1's climax: a six-part boss with one phase and two alternating, tell-then-fire attack
 * patterns, per the decision recorded in {@code 08-decisions-and-open-items.md} under "Level 1
 * climax and length".
 *
 * <p>Not stateless, the same deliberate exception {@code SpawnSystem} already is: it tracks its own
 * elapsed level time, which part entities it spawned, and the pattern state machine across many
 * ticks. A fresh {@code Simulation} always builds a fresh {@code BossSystem}, so this state is
 * exactly as reproducible as everything else the composition root creates once per run.
 *
 * <p><b>Footprint is an art fact, not content.</b> Six parts, their offsets and their radii are
 * fixed in {@code docs/design/02-sprite-sizes.md}/{@code 06-boss-presentation.md} and hardcoded here
 * as constants — the same treatment {@code Simulation} already gives the player's collider radius —
 * rather than read from {@link BossDefinition}, which carries only what genuinely varies with
 * balancing: hit points, timing and projectile speed.
 *
 * <p><b>The sixth part, {@code core-keel}.</b> The original five colliders left a 25 px gap below the
 * core's own circle — the keel, exactly where a player shooting up into the boss aims first — through
 * which a projectile visibly passed with nothing registering. Found by {@code visual-designer}
 * drawing the parts against {@code 02-sprite-sizes.md}'s map, fixed here per
 * {@code 06-boss-presentation.md}'s proposal: one more entity, radius 13.0 at offset (0, −27), plus
 * moving the arms from offset y −18 to −22. The keel carries its own {@link Health} and {@link
 * ScoreValue} — the core's own numbers, since it reads as part of the core rather than as a
 * fourth kind of part — and no {@link Sprite}: it draws nothing of its own, it only extends where a
 * hit against the core's existing drawn sprite actually registers. It dies with the core exactly like
 * a pod or an arm; its own death, on its own, ends nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>The pattern state machine, and the rear/front split added for issue #329.</b> The pods are the
 * rear weapon and keep exactly what shipped for #325: a cooldown, then a three-beat, 0.75 s tell — the
 * timing fixed in {@code docs/design/06-boss-presentation.md} — then an instantaneous fire, always
 * tied to a standstill. During the tell, the pods' {@link Sprite#frame} steps 1, 2, 3 and drops back to
 * 0 the instant the volley leaves, exactly the class javadoc there describes; that is the whole channel
 * presentation needs to draw the charge, so no separate "which part, how far" contract exists on
 * {@link dev.luchoc.littlespaceship.core.port.BossStatus}. The arms are the front weapon and fire on
 * their own clock — see {@link #updateFrontWeapons} — with no tell of their own: each shot locks the
 * player's position at the instant it fires rather than at the start of a charge, since there is no
 * charge to start one from. At the instant a pod tell begins, {@link #lockAim} freezes the player's
 * current position as that volley's aim point; a front shot computes its own, fresh, aim point the same
 * way, in {@link #computeAimPoint}, at the instant it fires. Every volley, rear or front, fans {@link
 * #FAN_COUNT} projectiles at its own locked point, not at a fixed outward or inward angle: {@link
 * #fireAimedFan} and {@link #FAN_SPREAD_RATIOS} carry the geometry and the reasoning. This is the
 * redesign task 4 of {@code docs/plan/11e-level-one-redesigned/plan.md} asked for, replacing the
 * fixed-angle fan that always missed a player parked at screen centre.
 *
 * <p><b>Defeat.</b> The core is the only part whose death ends the fight: once it is destroyed,
 * whatever keel, pods or arms remain are destroyed with it — a boss does not linger as a headless
 * husk — and {@link World#markBossDefeated()} is called, which is what {@code WorldView.outcome()}
 * requires for {@code LevelOutcome.COMPLETED} on a boss level. The keel, a pod or an arm can die
 * earlier, on its own, without ending anything; a pattern whose charging parts are both already dead
 * simply fires nothing and still completes its cycle, so the fight never stalls waiting on a part
 * that is gone.
 *
 * <p><b>Movement, added for issue #325, now a fixed duration per issue #329.</b> Once settled at
 * {@code combatY} and through every attack cycle after that, the boss travels between the ten vertices
 * of a five-pointed star — {@link #STAR_X}/{@link #STAR_Y} — never more than three perimeter steps per
 * move, per the project owner's design. A move only ever starts at the end of {@link #fireRearVolley},
 * after the rear volley has fully resolved, never mid-tell, so the fan in {@link #fireAimedFan} always
 * aims the rear volley from a standstill exactly as before: see {@link #beginMove} for why the two can
 * never overlap. Every move now takes exactly {@link #MOVE_DURATION}, whatever the distance — inverted
 * from #325's constant speed on the owner's own instruction, because a variable cycle length could not
 * hold the fixed front/rear ratio #329 asks for; see {@link #updateFrontWeapons}. Position is a pure
 * function of elapsed time and the destination draws from the seeded {@link World#rng()}, so a replay
 * reproduces the same sequence of points.
 *
 * <p><b>The front weapons deliberately break the move/attack exclusion, for themselves alone.</b> A
 * rear volley still cannot overlap a move — {@link FightStage#MOVING} is entered from exactly one call
 * site, {@link #fireRearVolley}'s caller, exactly as #325 built it. The front clock is not driven
 * through {@link FightStage} at all: {@link #updateFrontWeapons} runs every tick of {@code FIGHT}
 * regardless of {@link #fightStage}, called once per tick from {@link #updateFight} after the stage
 * switch, so a front shot fires whether the boss is cooling down, telling or travelling. Nothing else
 * reads or writes {@link #fightStage} from that method, so no second door into {@code MOVING} exists.
 *
 * <p><b>Damage and score need nothing new.</b> Every part is an ordinary {@code ENEMY}-layer,
 * non-fragile {@link Collider} carrying {@link Health} and {@link ScoreValue}, so {@code
 * DamageSystem}, {@code BombSystem} and {@code ScoreSystem} already resolve a hit against it, a bomb
 * detonation, and the points it awards with no boss-specific code at all — {@code core-keel} included,
 * even though it draws nothing: nothing downstream of {@code Collider}/{@code Health}/{@code
 * ScoreValue} needs a {@link Sprite} to exist.
