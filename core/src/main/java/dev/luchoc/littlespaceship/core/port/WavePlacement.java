/**
 * One entry of a level's ordered sequence of waves: which {@link WaveDefinition} to spawn and where,
 * relative to the placement before it — never to an absolute level time. A level carries no absolute
 * timestamps any more, per {@code docs/planning/08-decisions-and-open-items.md}, "The 11 group,
 * 27/08/2026".
 *
 * <p>The offset lives here, not on {@link WaveDefinition}, precisely so a wave stays reusable: the
 * same wave id can appear in two {@link WavePlacement}s of the same level, or of two different
 * levels, each with its own offset, without the wave's own declaration ever changing. Moving a
 * placement earlier in a level's list changes no other placement's own offset — each is relative
 * only to the one immediately before it in sequence, never to the file position of any declaration.
 *
 * <p>Not yet consumed by anything: {@code SpawnSystem} still walks the legacy {@link WaveTimeline}
 * until it migrates (issue #112), which is also the task that decides how a level's ordered list of
 * these gets from content into {@code ContentSource}.
 *
 * @param waveId the {@link WaveDefinition} to place, resolved through {@link ContentSource#wave(String)}
 * @param offsetSeconds seconds after the previous placement in the sequence ends when this one
 *     starts; may be negative to overlap it. For the first placement of a level, "the one before it"
 *     is level time zero.
