/**
 * One run of the game, assembled and ready to be ticked.
 *
 * <p>This is what the composition root builds, and the only thing it needs to know about the core:
 * everything it takes and everything it returns is a contract. The world, the entity registry, the
 * component stores and the systems stay inside, which is what stops presentation from reaching into
 * the ECS.
 *
 * <p>It takes a seed and not a generator, so no source of randomness other than the one in the core
 * can be injected. A run is reproducible from that seed plus the sequence of input frames, and that
 * is exactly what a replay stores.
 *
 * <p>Events are drained once the tick is over, never in the middle of it.
