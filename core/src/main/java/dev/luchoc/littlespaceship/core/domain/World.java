/**
 * Everything the simulation knows: which entities exist, what components they hold, and the three
 * services the systems share —randomness, content and the event queue—.
 *
 * <p>Stores are named, one field per component type, instead of a map keyed by class. It is more
 * lines and it is worth them: the domain stays explicit, the compiler checks every access, and
 * nothing has to be cast. Adding a component means adding a field here and freeing it in
 * {@link #destroyEntity(int)}, which is the one place that has to know every store.
 *
 * <p>The world does not run the systems and does not know they exist. Composing and running them is
 * the job of the application layer, which is what keeps the dependency between the two pointing in
 * a single direction.
 *
 * <p>Presentation never receives this object: it receives {@link #view()}, which can only read.
