/**
 * Expires projectiles once they leave the playfield, and removes an escaped enemy from the
 * simulation by two independent mechanisms, per the project owner's decision recorded in {@code
 * docs/planning/08-decisions-and-open-items.md} ("The 11 group, 27/08/2026") and closing issue #84.
 *
 * <p><b>Projectiles</b> are expired by a position check with a small {@link #PROJECTILE_MARGIN} past
 * the playfield edge, unchanged from before this issue: a run does not accumulate an unbounded number
 * of them over a level lasting several minutes, and every MVP projectile is a straight line, so "has
 * it left the playfield" is a position check, not a countdown.
 *
 * <p><b>Enemies</b> get two mechanisms, and the rule the whole thing exists to protect is the same
 * for both: neither ever removes an enemy still visible on screen.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@link Lifetime}, data set per archetype rather than a constant in code (the same call
 *       already made for attachment durability). Once {@link Lifetime#remaining} reaches zero the
 *       enemy is removed the moment it is also fully off the playfield — {@link
 *       #isFullyOffPlayfield}, which accounts for the entity's own {@link Collider#radius} so no part
 *       of its sprite is still visible. An enemy still on screen when its lifetime expires simply
 *       keeps existing until it leaves on its own or until the safety box below catches it. {@link
 *       Lifetime} is optional per archetype: an enemy with none relies on the safety box alone.
 *   <li>A <b>safety box</b>, a fixed margin ({@link #SAFETY_MARGIN}) well outside the playfield on
 *       every side, that removes any enemy touching it at once, regardless of whether it carries a
 *       {@link Lifetime}. This is the backstop for whatever a lifetime does not catch — an archetype
 *       with no {@link Lifetime} at all, or a movement shape (phase 11c) that wanders far without its
 *       lifetime ever expiring on screen. Being past the safety box already implies being fully off
 *       the playfield, so this removal never fires on a visible enemy either.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The safety box's size is measured against the worst legitimate spawn, not guessed.</b>
 * {@code SpawnSystem.positionSpawned} places a formation's lowest slot at {@code PLAYFIELD_HEIGHT +
 * radius}, and every other slot higher by its own {@code offsetY} spread. Measured against {@code
 * assets/data/formations.json} and {@code assets/data/enemies.json} on 27/08/2026, the worst case is
 * {@code column-3} (a 44-unit vertical spread) carrying {@code enemy-carrier} (the largest radius,
 * 15 units): its top slot is born at {@code y = 270 + 15 + 44 = 329}, {@code 314} measured from its
 * own edge ({@code y - radius}). {@link #SAFETY_MARGIN} is 128 units past every edge — clearing that
 * 314 by 84 units, deliberately more than the 44-unit floor the formations measured on this date
 * demand, since phase 11c adds movement shapes that travel further and must not be eaten by this box
 * on the way out and back in.
 *
 * <p><b>An enemy that escapes by either mechanism gives the player nothing</b> — decided by the
 * project owner on 28/08/2026: score rewards killing, not letting something through. This system is
 * the only thing that has to know that: an escaping enemy has its {@code ScoreValue}, {@code Drop}
 * and {@code Collider} stripped right here, before {@link World#markForDestruction(int)}, so {@code
 * ScoreSystem}, {@code CleanupSystem}'s drop resolution and its {@code EnemyDestroyed} emission — all
 * three already conditional on the component they read being present — simply find nothing to act on.
 * {@code CleanupSystem}'s own "converges every destruction path uniformly, regardless of what killed
 * its holder" stays exactly true: this system does not add a second, source-aware branch to it, it
 * only makes sure an escaped entity no longer carries anything a uniform sweep would find interesting.
