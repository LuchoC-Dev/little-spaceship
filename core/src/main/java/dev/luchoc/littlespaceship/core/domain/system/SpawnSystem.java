/**
 * Advances a level's ordered {@link WavePlacement} sequence and spawns what is due — the intensity
 * curve turned into entities.
 *
 * <p>Unlike most other systems, this one is not stateless: it holds the level id it was built for,
 * how much level time has elapsed, and every {@link ActiveWave} currently spawning or waiting on its
 * end condition. That is a deliberate exception to the pattern the other systems keep, not an
 * oversight — a fresh {@code Simulation} always builds a fresh {@code SpawnSystem}, so the state is
 * exactly as reproducible as everything else the composition root creates once per run.
 *
 * <p><b>How a level's placements resolve into running waves.</b> {@link WavePlacement#offsetSeconds()}
 * is relative to the end of the placement before it, so the next placement can only be scheduled once
 * the current one's end time is known — and the two end conditions know that at very different
 * moments. For a {@link WaveEndCondition.FixedDuration} wave the end time is deterministic —
 * {@code startTime + seconds} — the instant the wave itself starts, so {@link #scheduleNext} resolves
 * the placement after it <em>predictively</em>, right then, chaining through as many further
 * {@code FixedDuration} placements as follow consecutively. That is what lets a negative offset
 * genuinely overlap two waves: both are in {@link #activeWaves} at once, rather than the second only
 * appearing on the tick the first is removed. For a {@link WaveEndCondition.Cleared} wave the end
 * time cannot be known until it actually happens: {@code CLEANUP}, the stage that removes a spawned
 * entity, runs after {@code SPAWN} in the very same tick, so a wave clearing on this tick is only
 * visible to this system on the <em>next</em> one — {@code SPAWN} stays fifth in {@link SystemOrder},
 * and a {@code cleared} wave resolves one tick late as a direct, deterministic consequence of that
 * order, not a bug. Only this reactive case clamps its start forward to {@code levelTime}: it is the
 * one whose "end of the placement before it" is discovered after the fact, so a negative offset must
 * not retroactively spawn anything in the past. The predictive {@code FixedDuration} case carries no
 * such clamp — a negative offset there is free to place the next wave's start before the current
 * {@code levelTime}, which is exactly the overlap it is for.
 *
 * <p>Several waves can be active at once — that is what a negative offset is for — so every tick
 * first lets every active wave spawn whatever of its own {@link WaveDefinition#spawns()} is now due,
 * then checks every active wave's end condition and schedules the placement after any that just
 * ended. Because scheduling a new wave can itself make it immediately due this same tick (a
 * clamped-to-now start with a spawn at its own time zero), that two-phase step repeats until nothing
 * changes, bounded by the level's own placement count.
 *
 * <p>Each entity of a spawned wave is built the same way: an entity is created, every {@link
 * ComponentSpec} of the {@link EnemyDefinition} is handed to the {@link ComponentFactoryRegistry},
 * and only then is its {@code Transform} set from the wave's anchor plus the {@link FormationSlot}'s
 * offset — position is spawn-event data, never archetype data, so it is not something a component
 * factory could know. Every entity of a wave enters fully off-screen, regardless of its own size and
 * of the formation's shape: the anchor is pushed up by the formation's lowest {@code offsetY}
 * ({@link #lowestOffsetY}), so the slot closest to being visible is the one measured against the
 * playfield edge, and every other slot ends up further above it. A single-slot formation is the
 * special case of this where the lowest offset is its own, usually zero.
 *
 * <p>Every entity a wave spawns also carries a {@link WaveOrigin}, tagged with the {@link
 * WaveDefinition#id()} of the wave that spawned it — the string content id, not a synthetic per-call
 * counter, which is what lets {@link WaveEndCondition.Cleared} ask "does any entity still carry this
 * wave's id" and get a real answer even when the same wave id is placed twice in a level.
 * {@code SpawnerSystem} copies this tag onto the children a carrier spawns, per the carrier-children
 * rule in {@code docs/planning/08-decisions-and-open-items.md}.
