 * entity for destruction without anything reading a half-destroyed world afterwards. Reordering
 * these constants changes how the game behaves.
 *
 * <p>The pipeline runs the stages in declaration order and every system says which stage it belongs
 * to, so the order cannot be changed by accident when registering one. Stages with no system yet

     * <p>A spawn inside a spawn is exactly the kind of nested, same-tick ordering phase 02's own

     * system reading a buffer from a stage that runs before the stage refilling it resolves stale,
     * previous-tick data instead of the current tick's). This stage avoids the same class of mistake
     * two ways. First, it never mutates the very store it iterates — a spawned child never itself
     * carries a fresh {@code Spawner}, so {@code World#spawners()}'s dense array is never reordered
     * mid-loop, the hazard {@code ComponentStore}'s own documentation warns about. Second, iteration
     * is a plain index walk over that dense array — never a {@code HashMap} or a {@code Set} — so
     * which carrier's child is created first, when several are due the same tick, is exactly the
     * carriers' own creation order and nothing else, which is what keeps a replay reproducible.
