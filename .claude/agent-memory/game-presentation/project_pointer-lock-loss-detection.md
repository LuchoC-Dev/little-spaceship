description: how to detect the browser revoking Pointer Lock behind the game's back, and why pausing was chosen over a fallback or a resume prompt

`Gdx.input.setCursorCatched(true)` and a self-set boolean flag are not enough to know the pointer
is still captured. The browser (and the desktop backend on focus loss) can revoke the lock without
the game asking — alt-tab, a notification, clicking outside the canvas. `InputAdapter` used to
track only `pointerCaptureRequested`, a flag it set itself and had no way to know the platform had
overridden.

**Fix shape**: poll `Gdx.input.isCursorCatched()` — the platform's actual reported state — against
the flag each frame, inside the same method that already handles Escape's deliberate release
(`InputAdapter.managePointerCapture`). If the flag says captured but the platform says not, and
Escape wasn't the cause this frame, it's an unasked-for revocation. Escape's own release must be
checked as a separate condition in the same method, or the two get conflated and Escape trips the
"unexpected" path too.

**Design decision, not just implementation**: on an unexpected loss, `PlayScreen` pauses the game
using the overlay Escape already opens, rather than falling back to keyboard-only or drawing a new
click-to-resume prompt. Reasons: no new UI needed (`BaseUiScreen`/`GameSkin` already cover pause),
resuming already re-arms capture correctly through the existing click-to-capture path, and a
player who alt-tabs mid-fight is better off coming back to a frozen game than to a ship reading
garbage deltas from a freed cursor. See `docs/plan/11f-web-defects/status/41-pointer-lock-recovery.md`
(issue #41) for the full writeup.

**Still not checked**: real-browser confirmation that losing focus in Chrome/Firefox actually
triggers `isCursorCatched() == false` the way the desktop LWJGL3 backend does. Could not open a
real browser from this sandbox. This is exactly the kind of claim phase 09 got away with skipping —
don't repeat that; say "not checked" until someone with a real browser confirms it.
