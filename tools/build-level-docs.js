/**
 * Generate one markdown document per level from the content in `assets/data/`.
 *
 *     node tools/build-level-docs.js            # write docs/levels/<levelId>.md
 *     node tools/build-level-docs.js --check    # write nothing; exit 1 if anything would change
 *
 * The JSON is the source and the document is generated from it — phase 11d's decision, taken
 * because a document describing a level and a JSON defining it are two copies of one truth and one
 * of them always rots. `docs/plan/11d-per-level-document/document-contract.md` decides what the
 * document contains, section by section, and refuses the rest; this file implements exactly that
 * list. A section here the contract does not name is a bug in one of the two.
 *
 * No third-party dependency, per the precedent `docs/design/atlas/build-atlas.js` set: Node
 * built-ins only, so CI needs nothing installed.
 *
 * THE OUTPUT MUST BE A PURE FUNCTION OF THE CONTENT. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` regenerates and
 * fails if the working tree changes, which is the whole mechanism of the phase, and it dies the
 * moment the output carries anything the content does not determine. So: no timestamp, no git
 * hash, no version line, no absolute path, and every iteration over a collection is over an
 * explicitly ordered one. That is the constraint the contract's "Mechanical requirements" section
 * lists first, and the reason it lists it first.
 *
 * This is the second reader of the content after `game/adapter/content/JsonContentSource.java`, and
 * it deliberately does not reimplement that parser's validation — it resolves ids and dies on one it
 * cannot resolve. A document that printed a blank for a broken id would be a worse liar than a crash.

 * One index across every level: which wave ids exist, and who places them.

 * `assets/data/waves.json` is a single shared file with globally unique ids, and reuse across levels
 * is the reason phase 11b split waves from placements at all — but each level's document lists only
 * the waves that level places, so a designer could neither avoid an id collision nor find a reusable
 * wave without reading every other level's document. That is exactly the lookup outside the document
 * the contract's bar exists to remove. Found by task 4's read-back, #190, correction C5.
 *
 * Its own file, deliberately. The contract refuses a cross-level comparison *inside* a level's
 * document, because then every level's document changes when any level does; a separate file has no
